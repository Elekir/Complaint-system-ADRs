# ADR-003: Integration Mechanism

## Status
Accepted – 05/11/2025

## Decision
No external system integrations were implemented in the current version of the Complaint Management System (CMS).

## Rationale
This decision was made deliberately to keep the project within scope and ensure reliable delivery of core
complaint management functionality within the academic timeframe. While no integrations (e.g. chatbots or
third-party services) were developed, the selected three-tier architecture and Laravel backend support future
REST-based integrations without requiring architectural changes.
